  "description": "Creation of radiometrically terrain-corrected (RTC) products is a project of the Alaska Satellite Facility that makes SAR data accessible to a broader community of users. The project corrects synthetic aperture radar (SAR) geometry and radiometry, and presents the data in the GIS-friendly GeoTIFF format.Release of new ALOS PALSAR RTC products commenced October 2014 and was completed a year later. Data included in the RTC project are Fine Beam and Polarimetric scenes in all global land areas except Antarctica, Greenland, Iceland, and northern Eurasia.This collection is a subset over equatorial western Africa (N: 5.6, S: -8.6, E: 20.7, W: 6.5) for 16 May 2006 to 11 March 2011.",
